Display related words based on an anagram representation of a word.

For example: Lets say the input was "eatks"

output would be: steak, takes, skates

FYI: all of the outputs depend on the type of file you are feeding into the program. For example, if the dictionary does not contain skates, then the output would be limited to steak and takes.
